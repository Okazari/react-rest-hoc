# React Rest Resource

## Why ?

As i used `redux` along with `react` on a project, we decided to store data in an `api` reducer. We had to makes some asynchronous actions using `rdux-thunk`.
After some time i definitly felt not comfortable with this way of storing api data and i would've like to find another way to store my API data and to keep my redux store for one single use : Store my application state.

I assisted to a conference about reactive programming and i choosed to try something about observables resources.

Here it is !
